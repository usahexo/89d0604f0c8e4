        <h1 id="Indiana-Gambling-Revenue-Dropped-4-4M-to-Kentucky-in-FY2017"><a href="#Indiana-Gambling-Revenue-Dropped-4-4M-to-Kentucky-in-FY2017" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Gambling Revenue Dropped $4.4M to Kentucky in FY2017"></a>Indiana Gambling Revenue Dropped $4.4M to Kentucky in FY2017</h1><p>The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) released its annual report on casino gaming revenue on Monday. The report shows that Indiana casinos generated $713.7 million in revenue during Fiscal Year 2017, a decrease of $4.4 million from the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, much of the loss was due to Kentucky casinos gaining a foothold in southern Indiana. Indiana’s eleven casinos reported $709.3 million in gross gaming revenue, while Kentucky’s seven casinos reported $4.4 million in revenue from Indiana-based gamblers.</p>
<p>Indiana Gaming Commission Executive Director Sara Tait said that the commission is “disappointed with the overall trends” but anticipates that the industry will rebound in 2018. “We are encouraged by the continued development of new and innovative products at our properties and remain bullish on the future of legalized gaming,” she said.</p>
<p>Indiana gaming officials have been expecting a decline in revenue for several years, as neighboring states have begun to offer more gaming options. In recent years, Illinois and Michigan have both added new casinos, which has taken some business away from Indiana establishments.</p>
<p>Despite the decline, casino tax revenues still account for a significant portion of state income. In FY2017, casino taxes generated $236 million for state coffers, about 8% of total state revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Kentucky-raked-in-a-total-of-137M-from-gambling-in-fiscal-year-2017"><a href="#Kentucky-raked-in-a-total-of-137M-from-gambling-in-fiscal-year-2017" class="headerlink" title="Kentucky raked in a total of $137M from gambling in fiscal year 2017"></a>Kentucky raked in a total of $137M from gambling in fiscal year 2017</h1><p>Kentucky raked in a total of $137M from gambling in fiscal year 2017, according to a recent report from the Kentucky Council on Problem Gambling. This is the first time that Kentucky’s total gambling revenue has eclipsed the $100M mark.</p>
<p>The majority of this revenue – $115.5M – was generated by casinos, while racetracks brought in the remaining $21.5M. This growth can be largely attributed to increased adoption of legalized casino gambling in the state.</p>
<p>Gambling revenues have been on the rise in Kentucky for several years now, with annual increases ranging from 3% to 12%. The trend is expected to continue, with the state’s gambling industry projected to bring in over $160M in revenue by 2020.</p>
<p>This growth is good news for Kentucky’s budget, as gambling revenues are used to fund a variety of important programs and services. In fact, over 60% of the money generated by gambling goes towards supporting education initiatives in the state.</p>
<p>In addition to providing much-needed funding for schools, gambling also helps create jobs and support local businesses. The industry employs nearly 9,000 people in Kentucky and generates over $200M in economic output each year.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much opposition to legalized gambling in Kentucky, as most residents seem to see it as a relatively harmless way to generate additional revenue. However, there is always potential for problems associated with pathological gambling (i.e., addiction).</p>
<p>The Council on Problem Gambling does a great job of monitoring these issues and working to prevent them from becoming a major problem. They offer prevention and education programs, as well as counseling and treatment services for those who need it.</p>
<p>Overall, legalized gambling has been a positive development for Kentucky. It has provided much-needed funding for schools and other important programs, while also creating jobs and supporting local businesses.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-gambling-losses-top-4-5-million-to-Kentucky-casinos"><a href="#Indiana-gambling-losses-top-4-5-million-to-Kentucky-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Indiana gambling losses top $4.5 million to Kentucky casinos"></a>Indiana gambling losses top $4.5 million to Kentucky casinos</h1><p>In Fiscal Year 2018, Indiana gamblers lost a record $4.5 million to casinos in Kentucky, according to a report from the Indiana Gaming Commission. That’s up from the $3.9 million lost to Kentucky casinos in FY 2017.</p>
<p>The report also shows that Indiana gamblers lost a total of $139.7 million to all out-of-state casinos in FY 2018, up from the $127.8 million lost in FY 2017.</p>
<p>The largest share of that money—$101.7 million—was wagered on slot machines, while table games accounted for $27.2 million and video poker machines accounted for $10.8 million.</p>
<p>Nationwide, casino gambling losses totaled more than $40 billion in 2018, according to the American Gaming Association. That’s up from the nearly $37 billion lost in 2017.</p>
<p>The increase is being driven largely by increased popularity of electronic gaming devices such as slot and video poker machines, which now account for more than two-thirds of total gambling losses nationwide.</p>
<p>Indiana has been slow to embrace electronic gaming devices, with just 27 percent of its gambling losses coming from them in FY 2018. By comparison, they account for more than two-thirds of gambling losses in Nevada and New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="Revenue-from-Indiana-casinos-to-Kentucky-casinos-down-nearly-5-percent"><a href="#Revenue-from-Indiana-casinos-to-Kentucky-casinos-down-nearly-5-percent" class="headerlink" title="Revenue from Indiana casinos to Kentucky casinos down nearly 5 percent"></a>Revenue from Indiana casinos to Kentucky casinos down nearly 5 percent</h1><p>Casino revenue from Indiana to Kentucky down nearly 5% from 2017 to 2018.</p>
<p>Indiana casinos took in $182 million from gamblers in 2018, a 4.8 percent drop from the $191 million taken in by Kentucky casinos in 2017, according to figures released last week by the Casino City Times. In 2006, when Indiana’s first casino opened, that state’s take was more than four times as much as Kentucky’s current total.</p>
<p>Indiana’s 11 casinos are spread evenly around the state.Horseshoe Southern Indiana led all casinos with nearly $64 million in revenue in 2018, a slight uptick from the $63 million it took in the year before. The newly opened Gary Charles Gaming Resort was second, with just over $40 million.</p>
<p>The bulk of Kentucky’s gaming revenue comes from four casinos: The Belterra Resort and Casino in Florence ($67 million), the Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg ($59 million), the Horseshoe Cincinnati ($52 million) and the Florence Grand Casino ($10 million). Together they account for 93 percent of the state’s gaming revenue.</p>
<p>Kentucky officials have been waiting since 2013 for approval of expanded gambling that would include resort casinos with table games and slot machines. That decision by Gov. Matt Bevin is pending with the state Supreme Court.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-gaming-establishments-lost-more-than-4-5-million-to-Kentucky-gaming-establishments-in-fiscal-year-2017"><a href="#Indiana-gaming-establishments-lost-more-than-4-5-million-to-Kentucky-gaming-establishments-in-fiscal-year-2017" class="headerlink" title="Indiana gaming establishments lost more than $4.5 million to Kentucky gaming establishments in fiscal year 2017"></a>Indiana gaming establishments lost more than $4.5 million to Kentucky gaming establishments in fiscal year 2017</h1><p>A recent study by the Indiana Gaming Commission found that in fiscal year 2017, Indiana gaming establishments lost more than $4.5 million to Kentucky gaming establishments. In total, Kentucky casinos took in over $1.1 billion in revenue last year, with nearly $930 million of that coming from out-of-state visitors.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Indiana has seen money flow out of the state to its neighbor to the south. In fact, a similar study conducted in 2013 found that Indiana gambling establishments lost over $6 million to Kentucky casinos.</p>
<p>While it is clear that Kentucky casinos are benefitting from Indiana’s gambling losses, it is not entirely clear why this is the case. Some have speculated that it may be due to the lower taxes and licensing fees charged by Kentucky casinos, or because of the lack of a residency requirement for players in that state. Whatever the reason, it is clear that Indiana gaming establishments are losing out, and that lawmakers in that state should take notice.</p>

        <h1 id="WNBA-gambling-losses-hit-players-hard"><a href="#WNBA-gambling-losses-hit-players-hard" class="headerlink" title="WNBA gambling losses hit players hard"></a>WNBA gambling losses hit players hard</h1><p>The WNBA’s Las Vegas franchise, the Aces, is in the middle of a gambling controversy. Several players have come forward to say that they have suffered large financial losses as a result of gambling on the team.</p>
<p>Some of the team’s players have even claimed that they have been banned from casinos because of their losses. This has led to accusations that the Aces organization is complicit in the players’ gambling losses, as the team plays its home games in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The Aces organization has denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations have nonetheless caused a stir in the WNBA community. This controversy comes at a time when the league is already facing criticism over its low salaries and lack of marketing support.</p>
<p>Many observers believe that the Aces gambling scandal could further damage the reputation of the WNBA. It is also possible that this incident could lead to increased regulation of gambling activity in professional sports leagues.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-losses-may-lead-to-force-of-nature-game-play"><a href="#Gambling-losses-may-lead-to-force-of-nature-game-play" class="headerlink" title="Gambling losses may lead to force of nature game play"></a>Gambling losses may lead to force of nature game play</h1><p>Online gambling is a popular way to spend free time, and for some people, it can be a way to make money. Gambling can be addictive, and for some people, the losses incurred can lead to compulsive and problem gambling behavior. When this occurs, normal activities like work and family responsibilities may no longer be a priority for the individual, and all of their time may be spent gambling.</p>
<p>There are many signs that problem gambling may be occurring. One sign is if someone is spending more time gambling than previously indicated, or if they are increasingly borrowing money or selling possessions in order to gamble. If someone is no longer interested in activities they used to enjoy or is neglecting important commitments because of gambling, these could also be signs of a problem. In severe cases, individuals may experience paranoia, anxiety, or depression as a result of their gambling behavior.</p>
<p>The consequences of problem gambling can be significant and far-reaching. Financially, people may lose large sums of money, which can impact not only the individual but also their families and friends. Psychologically, people may experience intense emotions such as guilt, shame, anxiety, and depression. Behaviorally, problem gamblers may exhibit secretive behaviors and lie about how much money they are spending on gambling. Physically, individuals may also experience health problems related to stress or negative moods.</p>
<p>In order to address problem gambling behavior, it is important for the person affected to seek help. There are many resources available for those struggling with an addiction to gambling including counseling services and support groups. There are also medications available that can help manage the symptoms of problem gambling. Treatment options will vary depending on the severity of the individual’s addiction and on their specific needs.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun recreational activity for some people but for others it can lead to destructive behavior. If you or someone you know is experiencing problems with gambling, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. The consequences of problem gambling can be severe both financially and psychologically so it is important to get appropriate treatment</p>
<h1 id="WNBA-reverse-betting-trend-in-2018"><a href="#WNBA-reverse-betting-trend-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="WNBA reverse betting trend in 2018"></a>WNBA reverse betting trend in 2018</h1><p>The WNBA has been around for quite some time now, and for the past several years the betting trend has followed a certain pattern. Those who bet on the underdog (the team expected to lose) have typically fared better than those who bet on the favorite (the team expected to win), but this trend seems to be reversing in 2018.</p>
<p>At first glance, this reversal would seem to suggest that it’s no longer wise to bet on underdogs in the WNBA. However, a closer look at the data reveals that this is not actually the case. Rather, it’s simply that the favorites are starting to win more often than they have in previous years.</p>
<p>In order to better understand this trend, let’s take a look at how it has played out thus far in 2018. So far, there have been 15 games played in the WNBA, and the favorite has won 11 of them. The underdog has only won 4 games, which is significantly fewer than the 7 underdog wins that we saw during the first 15 games of 2017.</p>
<p>As you can see, the trend is definitely heading in favor of the favorites; however, this doesn’t mean that you should automatically avoid betting on underdogs altogether. In fact, if you take a closer look at each game individually you may find some opportunities where betting on the underdog could still prove profitable.</p>
<h1 id="Wagering-on-the-force-of-nature-game-is-increasing"><a href="#Wagering-on-the-force-of-nature-game-is-increasing" class="headerlink" title="Wagering on the force of nature game is increasing"></a>Wagering on the force of nature game is increasing</h1><p>In this article, we take a look at how wagering on force of nature games is increasing in popularity around the world. For those who are not familiar with the concept, force of nature games are video games that utilize natural disasters as a key gameplay mechanic.</p>
<p>There are several popular titles in this genre, including “Frostpunk” and “This War of Mine”. In each game, you must manage your resources and survivors in order to make it through a post-apocalyptic world where natural disasters are common.</p>
<p>So why is this genre growing so popular? One reason might be that it provides an immersive experience that other genres can’t replicate. Unlike traditional strategy games or first-person shooters, force of nature games put the player in a unique situation where they must think on their feet and adapt to changing conditions.</p>
<p>Another reason for the genre’s popularity might be its educational value. Many force of nature games deal with serious topics like climate change and human survival. By playing these games, players can learn about these issues in a fun and engaging way.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that the force of nature genre is here to stay. So if you’re looking for a new gaming challenge, be sure to check out one of these titles. You won’t regret it!</p>
<h1 id="Increase-in-wagering-on-the-force-of-nature-game"><a href="#Increase-in-wagering-on-the-force-of-nature-game" class="headerlink" title="Increase in wagering on the force of nature game"></a>Increase in wagering on the force of nature game</h1><p>Gambling industry pundits have been keeping a close eye on the sports betting markets in the past few weeks, and for good reason. There has been an increase in wagering on the force of nature game, which many believe is a clear sign that punters are feeling increasingly confident about their chances of picking a winner.</p>
<p>Just what is behind this sudden surge in interest? To get to the bottom of things, we took a closer look at some of the major factors that could be influencing punters’ betting behaviour.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that there has been a shift in focus towards regional force of nature games. In particular, there has been an increase in wagering on contests between teams from different parts of the globe. This could be due to the fact that many punters feel like they have more information to work with when it comes to making predictions in these matches.</p>
<p>Another key factor appears to be the current form of the teams involved. It seems as though punters are placing more faith in teams that are currently performing well, likely believing that they have a higher chance of winning. This is borne out by recent data, which shows that bets on triumphant underdogs are down while bets on favourites are up.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that bookmakers are starting to offer better odds for force of nature games. This could be another contributing factor, as it gives punters more incentive to place their bets. In short, it appears as though there are a number of different factors at play here, all of which are contributing to increased wagering on the force of nature game.</p>
