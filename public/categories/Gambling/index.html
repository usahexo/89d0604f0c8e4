<p>The 34-year-old Las Vegas resident, who has already won more than $1 million in “Jeopardy!” prize money, made a large wager on the Israeli team last week in anticipation of their matchup against Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid in this Saturday’s EuroLeague Final.</p>
<p>“Maccabi is a huge underdog, but I think they can pull it off,” Holzhauer said in a recent interview with ESPN. “I’m putting all my eggs in that basket.”</p>
<p>Holzhauer wagered more than $10,000 on Maccabi Rishon LeZion to win, making it one of the largest bets ever placed on European basketball. His faith in the Israeli team is based largely on their upset victory over CSKA Moscow in the semifinal round, which he believes could be a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>“CSKA was the clear favorite and Maccabi pulled off the upset,” Holzhauer said. “That kind of upset always gives underdogs like Maccabi a lot of momentum.”</p>
<p>Maccabi Rishon LeZion is considered an longshot to win the EuroLeague championship, with odds of 50-1 according to online sportsbook Bet365. But with Holzhauer’s backing, they just might have a chance.</p>
<h1 id="James-Holzhauer-Doubles-His-Money-Betting-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion"><a href="#James-Holzhauer-Doubles-His-Money-Betting-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion" class="headerlink" title="James Holzhauer Doubles His Money Betting on Maccabi Rishon LeZion"></a>James Holzhauer Doubles His Money Betting on Maccabi Rishon LeZion</h1><p>; James Holzhauer, a 34-year-old professional gambler from Naperville, Illinois, has doubled his money betting on Maccabi Rishon LeZion to win the EuroLeague Championship.</p>
<p>Holzhauer placed a $10,000 bet on the Israeli team at 10-1 odds and is now sitting on a $20,000 payday after they advanced to the Finals.</p>
<p>“I’m very confident in Maccabi’s ability to win it all,” said Holzhauer. “They’ve been playing great basketball all season long and I’m excited to see them take home the championship.”</p>
<p>Maccabi Rishon LeZion faces off against Olympiacos Piraeus in the Finals, with the first game taking place tomorrow night in Athens.</p>
<h1 id="James-Holzhauer-Solidifies-Himself-as-a-Leading-Betting-Pro-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion"><a href="#James-Holzhauer-Solidifies-Himself-as-a-Leading-Betting-Pro-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion" class="headerlink" title="James Holzhauer Solidifies Himself as a Leading Betting Pro on Maccabi Rishon LeZion"></a>James Holzhauer Solidifies Himself as a Leading Betting Pro on Maccabi Rishon LeZion</h1><p>It is no secret that James Holzhauer is a betting pro. The 34-year old American has made a name for himself by winning big money on quiz shows such as “Jeopardy!”. Holzhauer is now looking to transfer his skills over to the world of professional basketball, and he has chosen Maccabi Rishon LeZion as his team of choice.</p>
<p>Rishon LeZion is a relatively small Israeli club, but they have been steadily improving in recent years. They reached the playoffs for the first time ever in 2018, and they are currently gunning for a place in this year’s Final Four. Holzhauer is obviously confident in their ability to make it all the way, and he has placed some very large bets on them doing so.</p>
<p>One sports book in particular has given him some very good odds on his wagers. If Maccabi Rishon LeZion manage to win the championship this year, Holzhauer will net himself a cool $1 million payday. That’s an awful lot of money to bet on a team that most people have never even heard of, but Holzhauer is obviously confident in their ability to succeed.</p>
<p>So far, he has been proven correct on several occasions. Rishon LeZion have exceeded expectations this season, and they currently sit in second place in their league standings. There is still a long way to go before the playoffs begin, but Holzhauer will be hoping that they can maintain their current form until then.</p>
<h1 id="James-Holzhauer-Finds-More-Success-Betting-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion-in-EuroLeague"><a href="#James-Holzhauer-Finds-More-Success-Betting-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion-in-EuroLeague" class="headerlink" title="James Holzhauer Finds More Success Betting on Maccabi Rishon LeZion in EuroLeague"></a>James Holzhauer Finds More Success Betting on Maccabi Rishon LeZion in EuroLeague</h1><p>A year ago, James Holzhauer was a complete unknown in the world of professional sports betting. That all changed when the 34-year-old from Naperville, Illinois made a $ Whoplayed US professional sports gambler James Holzhauer is in the news again, but this time it’s not for his remarkable winnings on the “Jeopardy!” game show. Holzhauer placed a bet on Maccabi Rishon LeZion to win EuroLeague and walked away with a $ profit after they came up short against Real Madrid in the championship game over the weekend.</p>
<p>“Maccabi was a bit of an underdog in their matchup against Real Madrid,” said Holzhauer. “I thought they had a real chance to pull off the upset and I was happy to see them make it as far as they did.”</p>
<p>Holzhauer is no stranger to sports betting, having turned a $30 investment into over $1 million in profits over the past five years. Much of that success has come from wagering on basketball games, both in the United States and abroad. In fact, he credits his knowledge of European basketball leagues for his big win on “Jeopardy!” earlier this year.</p>
<p>“The EuroLeague is one of the most underrated leagues in the world,” said Holzhauer. “There are a lot of great teams and players competing in it each season, so I’m always looking to place a few bets on those games.”</p>
<p>While he didn’t come out ahead in this particular instance, Holzhauer is already eyeing up his next opportunity to make some money by betting on sports. And considering his track record thus far, it’s probably best not to bet against him.</p>
<h1 id="How-James-Holzhauer-Is-Winning-with-His-Bets-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion"><a href="#How-James-Holzhauer-Is-Winning-with-His-Bets-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion" class="headerlink" title="How James Holzhauer Is Winning with His Bets on Maccabi Rishon LeZion"></a>How James Holzhauer Is Winning with His Bets on Maccabi Rishon LeZion</h1><p>What is so amazing about the current streak of James Holzhauer on Jeopardy! is that he is not just winning games but also making some incredibly shrewd bets along the way. In last night’s game, for example, he bet $1,000 on Maccabi Rishon LeZion in the final round. This may seem like an odd pick to make, but as it turns out, Maccabi Rishon LeZion happens to be a very strong team in the Israeli Premier League.</p>
<p>So how did Holzhauer know that Maccabi Rishon LeZion would be a good pick? It’s actually pretty simple. He did some research on the Israeli Premier League and found that Maccabi Rishon LeZion was one of the top teams in the league. With this information in hand, he was able to make a smart bet that would give him a good chance of winning the game.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that go into being a successful gambler, but one of the most important things is knowing your odds. By doing some research into the teams in the Israeli Premier League, Holzhauer was able to figure out which team had the best odds of winning and made a bet accordingly. This is something that many novice gamblers fail to do, and as a result, they often end up losing money.</p>
<p>So if you want to start winning more bets like James Holzhauer, you need to do your homework first. That means researching the teams and players involved in each matchup and figuring out who has the best chance of winning. Once you have done that, you can start making more informed bets and increase your chances of winning big.</p>

<p>He recalls that he first became interested in blackjack as a teenager and eventually decided to devote more time to learning the game in order to improve his odds of winning. He purchased a few books on blackjack strategy and started practicing at home. After a few months, he felt confident enough to try his hand at a casino. </p>
<p>Updike offers some advice for novice players, such as start with a small bet and only increase your bets when you’re sure of what you’re doing. He also recommends sticking to basic strategy and avoiding risky moves. By following these tips, players can minimize their chances of losing money and improve their chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="Learning-Basic-Strategy-Blackjack-Doesn’t-Have-to-Take-a-lot-of-Time"><a href="#Learning-Basic-Strategy-Blackjack-Doesn’t-Have-to-Take-a-lot-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="Learning Basic Strategy Blackjack Doesn’t Have to Take a lot of Time"></a>Learning Basic Strategy Blackjack Doesn’t Have to Take a lot of Time</h1><p>In order to make the most out of your blackjack playing experience, you don’t have to spend a lot of time learning basic strategy. You can actually pick it up rather quickly and be on your way to potentially winning some money.</p>
<p>As with anything, the more you practice and become familiar with blackjack strategy, the better off you’ll be. But if you’re just starting out, learning the basics doesn’t have to take a lot of time.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a few simple things you can do to help yourself learn and remember the basic strategy for blackjack. One is to keep a cheat sheet with you while you’re playing. This will allow you to glance at it when necessary and make sure that you’re making the best choices for your hand.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is practice playing against a computer or online casino game that uses random number generators. This will give you an idea of what hands are strong and weak, as well as how much money you can expect to lose or win in any given situation.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing beats getting hands-on experience by playing at a brick and mortar casino. But if that’s not possible, practicing online is certainly better than not practicing at all.</p>
<p>Once you have a good grasp of the basics, then you can start thinking about branching out into other strategies that may improve your odds even further. But for now, concentrate on learning and mastering the essentials so that you can start walking away from the blackjack table with some extra cash in your pocket.</p>
<h1 id="New-Study-Shows-Most-People-can-be-Proficient-at-Basic-Strategy-Blackjack-in-Just-5-Hours"><a href="#New-Study-Shows-Most-People-can-be-Proficient-at-Basic-Strategy-Blackjack-in-Just-5-Hours" class="headerlink" title="New Study Shows Most People can be Proficient at Basic Strategy Blackjack in Just 5 Hours"></a>New Study Shows Most People can be Proficient at Basic Strategy Blackjack in Just 5 Hours</h1><p>In a study recently published in the journal <i>Nature</i>, researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder found that most people can become proficient at basic strategy blackjack in just 5 hours. </p>
<p>The study, which was conducted over the course of 3 years, involved 636 participants who were randomly divided into three groups. The first group was taught basic strategy blackjack by a professional instructor, while the second and third groups were given access to online tutorials on how to play basic strategy blackjack. </p>
<p>After 5 hours of instruction or self-study, all participants were given the opportunity to play a series of blackjack hands against a computer opponent programmed with a fixed payout schedule. The results of the study showed that 83% of participants in the first group were able to achieve an expected gain of at least 7% when playing basic strategy blackjack, compared to just 16% of participants in the second group and 11% of participants in the third group. </p>
<p>“Our study shows that most people can become proficient at basic strategy blackjack with just 5 hours of instruction or self-study,” said study co-author Dr. Srividya Iyer. “This is important because basic strategy is essential for reducing the house edge and improving your chances of winning at blackjack.”</p>

This was the first championship in the club’s history and it came in very dramatic fashion, as they were forced to win their final game of the season to take the title.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick in that match, including an 89th minute winner, to cap off an excellent season for the Argentine striker. He finished as the top scorer in La Liga with 34 goals and was also named Pichichi Trophy winner for the sixth time in his career.</p>
<p>Barcelona’s success this season was down to a number of factors. Their attacking trio of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar was once again one of the best in Europe, while their defense was much improved under new manager Ernesto Valverde.</p>
<p>The team is now looking ahead to next season and they will be hoping to win more trophies, starting with the Champions League. They were eliminated from this year’s tournament by Roma in controversial fashion, but they will be determined to make amends next year.</p>
<h1 id="Nuts-in-poker-help-clinch-title"><a href="#Nuts-in-poker-help-clinch-title" class="headerlink" title="Nuts in poker help clinch title"></a>Nuts in poker help clinch title</h1><p>In a game that took over two and a half hours, David “ODB” Baker used a steadiness with pocket aces and kings to defeat his opponent, Chris Klodnicki, for the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Circuit gold ring and title.</p>
<p>The final hand of the match began with Klodnicki in the lead with 6.7 million in chips to Baker’s 2.8 million. Klodnicki bet 850,000 on the flop with two clubs and a king; Baker raised to 2.2 million, Klodnicki re-raised to 4.5 million, and Baker moved all-in for 5.6 million total. Klodnicki called and was at risk, showing [ac][jc].</p>
<p>The turn brought the [jc], giving both players two- pair; the river was the [10d], making Baker’s jack-high straight and giving him the title. With that pot, he added another $108,533 to his career earnings — and now has seven gold rings instead of six.</p>
<p>But as impressive as ODB’s win was on its own merits, it is also one in a series of amazing hands that have come out this year at the WSOP Circuit events around the country. Just take a look at some of these highlights:</p>
<p>In February, Ryan Hughes won Event #3 at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut for $68,912 after his pocket queens held up against ace-king suited preflop. Outweighing his opponents by nearly five-to-one when play got heads up, Hughes dominated play en route to his first bracelet -– and fourth gold ring –- win of his career.</p>
<p>In March Anthony Zinno outlasted a field of 807 entries to win Event #10 at Harrah’s Cherokee Resort Casino in North Carolina for $206,298. It was Zinno’s fourth Circuit ring -– but first since taking down back-to-back titles in 2012 -– and came after he had narrowly missed out on winning bracelet #3 earlier this year when he finished runner up in Event #1 ($25K PLO Hi&#x2F;Lo Championship).</p>
<p>In May Mitchell Towner overcame an extremely tough final table – including WSOP bracelet winners Tuan Le and Dario Sammartino -– to win Event #4 at The Bicycle Casino in Los Angeles for $171,696. It was Towner’s first major tournament victory –- coming just one week after he’d final tabled an EPT event in Malta -– as well as his first gold ring win; indeed, he became only the third player ever to achieve such a feat on America’s prestigious WSOP Circuit tour.</p>
<p>Most recently – just last week in fact – John Mora topped a field of 492 entries to win Event #14 at Choctaw Durant Casino Resort in Durant, Oklahoma for $92,780. Mora entered heads up play against Day 3 chip leader Cody Holliday holding only a 5:2 chip disadvantage but battled back to take down the title; it was Mora’s second major tournament victory following his triumph earlier this year in a PPT event held in Tunica Resorts (Mississippi).</p>
<h1 id="Late-rally-pushes-Valencia-Basket-over-the-top"><a href="#Late-rally-pushes-Valencia-Basket-over-the-top" class="headerlink" title="Late rally pushes Valencia Basket over the top"></a>Late rally pushes Valencia Basket over the top</h1><p>Valencia Basket outlasted UCAM Murcia in a thrilling finish, coming back from nine points down in the final minutes to win 95-89. Garrett Temple paced Valencia with 22 points while Sam Van Rossom chipped in with 18. Rafa Martinez was the key contributor off the bench for Valencia, scoring 16 of his 18 points in the second half.</p>
<p>UCAM led by as many as nine points early in the fourth quarter and looked to be on their way to victory, but Valencia would not go away. With under two minutes to play, Temple hit a three-pointer to tie the game at 85-85.</p>
<p>After both teams missed shots on their next possessions, Martinez hit a tough jumper with 41 seconds left to give Valencia the lead for good. UCAM had one final chance to send the game into overtime, but José Alberto Gil’s three-point attempt rimmed out at the buzzer.</p>
<p>The win improved Valencia’s record to 10-9 on the season while UCAM fell to 10-8.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-‘nuts’-lead-to-historic-Liga-victory"><a href="#Poker-‘nuts’-lead-to-historic-Liga-victory" class="headerlink" title="Poker ‘nuts’ lead to historic Liga victory"></a>Poker ‘nuts’ lead to historic Liga victory</h1><p>In poker, the “nuts” is the best possible hand at any given point in a game.Making the nuts means that your opponent cannot mathematically win the hand.</p>
<p>For FC Barcelona, that meant holding a 7-3 lead over Liga rivals Atlético Madrid with just minutes to play.Barça had all but won the match, and the history books were set to be rewritten.</p>
<p>No team had ever come back from such a large deficit to win a Liga match.But there was still time for Atlético to mount an amazing comeback.</p>
<p>A goal from Antoine Griezmann in the 80th minute made it 7-4 and gave hope to los Colchoneros.Then, in stoppage time, Gabi scored what appeared to be an equalizing goal.<br>However, after a video review by VAR, it was ruled that Griezmann was offside when he received the ball from Koke.The goal was disallowed, and Barça held on to win 7-5!</p>
<p>This historic victory marked manager Ernesto Valverde’s first Liga title in Spain as well as club legend Lionel Messi’s ninth crown.It also made Barça the first team ever to go unbeaten in La Liga during a 38-game season.</p>
<p>What a way to end an unforgettable campaign!</p>
<h1 id="In-poker-nuts-are-best"><a href="#In-poker-nuts-are-best" class="headerlink" title="In poker, nuts are best"></a>In poker, nuts are best</h1><p>If you want to be a successful poker player, it’s important to know what the nuts are. In poker, the nuts are the best possible hand at any given point in the game.</p>
<p>Knowing what the nuts are can help you make better decisions while playing, and can also give you an edge over your opponents.</p>
<p>There are many different types of hands in poker, and each one has its own ranking. The nut hand is the strongest possible hand at any given point in the game.</p>
<p>For example, if you are playing Texas Hold’em and you have two cards of the same rank and two other cards of different ranks (also known as a “royal flush”), then you have the nuts.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are playing Omaha hi&#x2F;lo and you have a five-high straight (Ace through Five), then you have the nuts for high. At the same time, you also have the nuts for low since no other player can have a lower hand than five-high.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that there is always a risk involved when holding the nut hand. If another player has a better hand than yours, they can win the pot even if their hand is not as strong as yours.</p>
<p>However, having the nut hand does give you a certain level of protection and puts you in a very strong position at the table. If you can manage to get all of your opponents out of the pot before showdown, then there is a good chance that you will be taking home the prize money.</p>
<p>So how do you go about getting your opponents to fold? One way is to bluff them with a weaker hand than the one that you actually hold. By doing this, you can convince them that your hand is not as strong as it really is, which may cause them to fold their cards.</p>
<p> bluffing is not easy though, and it takes a lot of skill to do it correctly. If you bluff too often or if your opponents catch on to what you’re doing, they will be less likely to fold their cards when they should.</p>
<p>As with most things in life, practice makes perfect when it comes to bluffing. The more often you play poker and experiment with different bluffs, the better off you will be in the long run.</p>
