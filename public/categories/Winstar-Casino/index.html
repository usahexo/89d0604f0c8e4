<h1 id="How-much-money-does-they-make"><a href="#How-much-money-does-they-make" class="headerlink" title="How much money does they make?"></a>How much money does they make?</h1><p>A lot of people, when they think of the ultra-rich, they imagine people who have a lot of money. How much money do they make? is a question that may often come to mind. While there are many ways to answer this question, one way is to look at how much money the richest people in the world have.</p>
<p>According to a 2016 report by Bloomberg, Bill Gates is the richest person in the world with a net worth of $75 billion. Amancio Ortega, the founder of Inditex fashion group, which includes the retailer Zara, is second with a net worth of $67 billion. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., is third with a net worth of $60.8 billion. And Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com Inc., is fourth with a net worth of $45.2 billion.</p>
<p>These are just some examples, but it’s clear that those who are at the top of the list for wealthiest people in the world have billions and billions of dollars. So just how much money does that translate to on an annual basis? Well, if you were to divide each person’s net worth by 365 days, you would get an estimate for how much money each person makes per day. Gates’ daily income would be about $202,000; Ortega’s would be $176,000; Buffett’s would be $164,000; and Bezos’ would be $123,000.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these numbers are just estimates and do not account for things like taxes or other expenses. But it gives you an idea as to just how wealthy some of the people on this list are and how much money they make on a daily basis.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-their-net-worth"><a href="#What-is-their-net-worth" class="headerlink" title="What is their net worth?"></a>What is their net worth?</h1><p>As of July 2017, the richest person in the world is Bill Gates with a net worth of $89.9 billion. followed by Amancio Ortega with $85.3 billion and Warren Buffett with $75.6 billion. Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Carlos Slim round out the top six, with net worths of $72.8 billion, $71.3 billion, and $54.5 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>Collectively, the world’s 10 richest people are worth $426.2 billion, up from $415.4 billion in July 2016.</p>
<p>The biggest gainer this year is Zuckerberg, who has seen his net worth more than double from $34.7 billion to $71.3 billion thanks to strong performances by Facebook stock. Bezos is also doing well this year, with Amazon shares up 50%.</p>
<p>Notably absent from this year’s list are four of the world’s ten richest people in 2016: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud (net worth: $22.8 billion), Sergey Brin (net worth: $39.0 billion), Larry Page (net worth: $40.7 billion), and Lui Che Woo (net worth: $38.0 billion). All four saw their fortunes decline over the past year due to a variety of factors including lower oil prices and political instability in Saudi Arabia for Prince Alwaleed and weaker stock prices for Google parent company Alphabet Inc., for Brin and Page.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-they-do-with-all-their-money"><a href="#What-do-they-do-with-all-their-money" class="headerlink" title="What do they do with all their money?"></a>What do they do with all their money?</h1><p>Some people seem to have a lot of money, but what do they really do with it all? Do they just sit on it and stare at it, or do they use it to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>There are some people who use their money to help others. For example, there are some people who give a lot of their money to charity. They may donate to hospitals, homeless shelters, or other places that help people in need.</p>
<p>There are also some people who use their money to start their own businesses. This can help create jobs and improve the economy. People can also use their money to support causes they believe in. For example, they may donate to political campaigns or environmental organizations.</p>
<p>No matter what someone chooses to do with their money, it’s important that they do something good with it. It’s great that they have been able to accumulate so much wealth, but it would be a shame if they didn’t use it for good purposes.</p>
<h1 id="Why-are-they-so-successful"><a href="#Why-are-they-so-successful" class="headerlink" title="Why are they so successful?"></a>Why are they so successful?</h1><p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. The company’s hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, and the Apple Watch smartwatch. Its software includes the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iWork and iCloud productivity suites. Apple’s online services include the iTunes Store, the App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.</p>
<p>Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak,[10] and Ronald Wayne. The company’s first product was the Apple I personal computer kit. It was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic input&#x2F;output devices), which customers had to assemble themselves. The Apple I kits were computers designed by Jobs and Wozniak in Jobs’ parents’ garage.[11] They were manufactured by an outside company,[12] and box-shipped to San Francisco Bay Area retailers.[13]</p>
<p>The Apple II was introduced in 1977 with improved components; it featured an 8-bit microprocessor chip from MOS Technology,[14][15][16] which rendered 65 thousand colors onscreen from a palette of 16 million colors.[17][18][19] Sales increased significantly over the next few years as businesses increasingly purchased computers for use in their offices instead of using them as home consumer goods.[20] Jobs resigned from his position on September 17th 1985,[21]:193 after unsuccessfully trying to oust John Sculley as CEO but remaining on the Board of Directors,[22]:5 he served as Chairman of the Board until 1997.[23]:159 In addition to his CEO role at NeXT Computer[24], Jobs took on an advisory role at newly formed Pixar Animation Studios starting in 1986 until its acquisition by Disney in 2006 for $7.4 billion cumulated cash &amp; stock deal ($9 billion including assumption of debt).[25]:8</p>
<p>On December 3rd 1996,[26]:240 Jobs returned to become interim CEO after then-CEO Gil Amelio was fired[27]; one month later he became full-time CEO[28]. Jobs terminated all ongoing projects except for one - development of what would become known as OS X - during his tenure as CEO (1997-2011).[29]:193 On August 24th 2011 he resigned due to illness[30], handing leadership over to COO Tim Cook who ran day-to-day operations until Jobs’ death on October 5th 2011 due to pancreatic cancer.[31][32] He was survived by his wife Laurene Powell Jobs and four children: daughters Lisa Brennan-Jobs and Eve Jobs (from his first marriage), sons Reed Paul Jobs and Erin Sienna Jobs (from his second marriage), plus another child whose parentage is not public knowledge.</p>
<p>After founding NeXT Computer Inc., Steve Jobs resigned from his position there which led him back to work at Lucasfilm Ltd.’s computer graphics division which had been spun off into a new venture called Pixar Animation Studios where he became chairman of its board of directors. When Lucasfilm Ltd.’s owner decided to sell it off with Pixar being up for sale at one point also with offers from Microsoft Corporation among others before being bought by Walt Disney Productions for $7.4 billion in February 2006 spread out over an accumulation of Disney’s shares making it worth about $9 billion taking inflation into account</p>
