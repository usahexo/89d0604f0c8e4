Before you take any steps, be sure to read through our guide on how to close your account so that you can make an informed decision.</p>
<p>First, understand that closing your account will permanently delete all of your data and information associated with it. This includes any money you may have deposited into your account. So, if you’re considering closing your account, make sure you have access to any funds you may have deposited.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to proceed, the first step is to contact customer support and let them know that you would like to close your account. They will ask for some basic information including your name, username, and email address associated with the account.</p>
<p>Once they have this information, they will verify that you are the account holder and then direct you on how to proceed. In most cases, you will be asked to provide a reason for closing the account. This is for Pulse Casino’s records and is not mandatory, but we recommend providing a reason nonetheless.</p>
<p>After providing all of the required information, customer support will forward your request on to our Accounts team who will begin the process of closing your account. This process can take up to 72 hours, so please be patient.</p>
<p>Once the process is complete, your account will be closed and all data will be permanently deleted. If you have any questions or concerns along the way, please don’t hesitate to contact customer support for assistance.</p>
