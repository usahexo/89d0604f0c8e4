If you match three symbols, then you will win a prize which could be chips, gold coins, or even other items such as new weapons or armour.</p>
<p>If exchanging your gold for chips at the casino desk is more your thing, then you can do so by speaking to the casino attendant who is located next to the entrance. He will ask how many chips you would like to exchange your gold for and give you a quote. Make sure that you have enough gold on hand though, as he won’t exchange any less than 1,000 gold coins at once.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you don’t feel like playing slots or exchanging your gold for chips, then you can always purchase chips from the casino shop. The shop sells different quantities of chips, with prices starting at 2,000 gold coins for 1,000 chips. So whatever your method of getting chips may be, there’s always a way for you to obtain them and get started in this casino!</p>
