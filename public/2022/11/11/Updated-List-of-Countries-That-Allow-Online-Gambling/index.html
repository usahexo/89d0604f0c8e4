This list is updated regularly to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h1 id="Countries-Allowing-Online-Gambling-To-Grow"><a href="#Countries-Allowing-Online-Gambling-To-Grow" class="headerlink" title="Countries Allowing Online Gambling To Grow"></a>Countries Allowing Online Gambling To Grow</h1><p>Online gambling is gaining in popularity all over the world and more countries are legalizing it as they see the benefits it has to offer their citizens. While some countries have always been open to gambling, others are just starting to come around to the idea, recognizing that it can be a great way to add revenue to state coffers and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>The Netherlands was one of the first countries to legalize online gambling and they have reaped the rewards. In 2017, they made almost EUR 800 million from online gambling taxes and licensing fees, which is a considerable increase over the EUR 343 million they earned in 2016. This increase can be attributed to the fact that more operators are now licensed in The Netherlands, as well as to rising global demand for online gambling products.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is also seeing a surge in online gambling activity, with revenue from Betting Duty on online Gross Gambling Yield (GGY) reaching GBP 1.7 billion in 2017-18, up from GBP 1.3 billion in 2016-17. Much of this growth is being driven by increases in sports betting, which has seen an influx of new players since the repeal of the British ban on single-game betting in 2018.</p>
<p>Australia is another country that is benefiting from the growth of online gambling. In 2017-18, Australian gambling operators generated AUS $2.7 billion in revenue from online sports betting alone, up from AUS $2.1 billion in 2016-17. This growth is being fueled by a combination of increased interest in sports betting and relaxed regulation of the industry.</p>
<p>As more countries realize the potential benefits of online gambling, we can expect even more growth in this sector in years to come. This expansion will benefit not only casino operators and other service providers but also consumers who will have access to an ever-growing selection of fun and safe gaming options.</p>
