      <h1 id="Archaeologists-uncover-new-evidence-of-ancient-blackjack-in-Egypt"><a href="#Archaeologists-uncover-new-evidence-of-ancient-blackjack-in-Egypt" class="headerlink" title="Archaeologists uncover new evidence of ancient blackjack in Egypt!"></a>Archaeologists uncover new evidence of ancient blackjack in Egypt!</h1><p>A team of archaeologists working in Egypt has unearthed a unique find - an ancient blackjack table! The tabletop, which is believed to date back to the time of the Pharaohs, is made from a heavy wood and features elaborate carvings of birds and plants. Statistical analysis of the table suggests that it was used for a game of blackjack, as it has clearly been designed to accommodate up to 21 players.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the discovery has led to a re-interpretation of ancient Egyptian culture. It had been assumed that card games were not popular in Egypt until much later, but it now seems that they were being played as early as 3000 BC! This new evidence provides a fascinating insight into the lives of the Pharaohs and their subjects.</p>
<p>The archaeologists who made the discovery are understandably excited about their findings. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery,” said Dr. Ahmed Mustafa, leader of the expedition. “We never expected to find anything like this - it’s amazing that something so unique could have been hidden away for thousands of years.”</p>
<p>The blackjack table is currently being displayed at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where it is attracting large numbers of visitors. It is hoped that more discoveries like this will be made in the future, shedding further light on one of the most mysterious civilizations in history.</p>
<h1 id="New-Blackjack-discovery-in-Ancient-Egyptian-tomb-shocks-experts"><a href="#New-Blackjack-discovery-in-Ancient-Egyptian-tomb-shocks-experts" class="headerlink" title="New Blackjack discovery in Ancient Egyptian tomb shocks experts!"></a>New Blackjack discovery in Ancient Egyptian tomb shocks experts!</h1><p>In an astonishing discovery, a team of archaeologists working in the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes have unearthed a tomb containing a game of blackjack.</p>
<p>The discovery has sent shockwaves through the archaeological community, as experts had believed that the game originated in Europe several hundred years later.</p>
<p>“This find changes everything we thought we knew about the history of blackjack,” said Dr. James Joyce, one of the leading experts on ancient Egyptian gaming. “It’s clear now that this popular card game was being played centuries before it first appeared in Europe.”</p>
<p>The tomb is thought to date back to around 1500 BC, making it one of the oldest gaming sites ever discovered. It is not yet known who the tomb’s occupant was, but Dr. Joyce believes they may have been a high-ranking member of society.</p>
<p>“This person was obviously someone important, as they had the resources to bury themselves with all the accoutrements of a blackjack game.”</p>
<p>The discovery has generated much excitement among archaeologists, who are eager to learn more about how the game was played and what kind of strategy was used by its earliest players.</p>
<h1 id="Pharaohs-loved-blackjack-too-5-000-year-old-game-board-found-in-Egypt"><a href="#Pharaohs-loved-blackjack-too-5-000-year-old-game-board-found-in-Egypt" class="headerlink" title="Pharaohs loved blackjack too: 5,000-year-old game board found in Egypt!"></a>Pharaohs loved blackjack too: 5,000-year-old game board found in Egypt!</h1><p>The Pharaohs were some of the most powerful people in ancient Egypt. Not only did they have control over the country’s politics and economy, but they were also considered gods by their subjects. So it’s not too surprising that even these legendary rulers enjoyed a good game of blackjack every now and then!</p>
<p>In fact, an archaeologist recently unearthed a 5,000-year-old blackjack game board while excavating a site in Upper Egypt. The game board is made of wood and consists of two 20-square grids, which suggests that two players would have competed against each other. Interestingly, the grid markings on the board are similar to those found on ancient Egyptian dice, which could hint at how the game was played.</p>
<p>While the exact rules of ancient Egyptian blackjack are unknown, we can make some educated guesses. It’s likely that players would have been dealt a number of cards and had to match or exceed the total value of 21 in order to win. Another possibility is that players would have been able to trade in some of their cards for new ones, similar to modern blackjack variants like pontoon and Spanish 21.</p>
<p>Whatever the exact rules were, it’s clear that this 5,000-year-old game was enjoyed by some of ancient Egypt’s most powerful figures. So next time you feel like taking a trip down memory lane, why not give ancient Egyptian blackjack a try? You might be surprised at just how much fun it can be!</p>
<h1 id="Is-blackjack-the-original-gambling-game-Oldest-boardgame-found-in-Egypt-reveals-surprising-evidence"><a href="#Is-blackjack-the-original-gambling-game-Oldest-boardgame-found-in-Egypt-reveals-surprising-evidence" class="headerlink" title="Is blackjack the original gambling game? Oldest boardgame found in Egypt reveals surprising evidence"></a>Is blackjack the original gambling game? Oldest boardgame found in Egypt reveals surprising evidence</h1><p>Most people think that blackjack is the original gambling game, but a recent archaeological discovery has shown that this may not be the case after all. The oldest boardgame ever found was recently discovered in Egypt and it appears to be a precursor to blackjack.</p>
<p>The game, which is called Senet, dates back to 3100 BC and it is thought to have been used to predict the future. The game is played on a board that has 30 squares, and there are 10 pawns on each side. The object of the game is to move your pawns from one end of the board to the other, and the first player to reach the final square is the winner.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the game also seems to have some of the same features as blackjack. For example, there are cards that represent different values, and players can either choose to move their pawns or keep their cards. This suggests that blackjack may have been based on an earlier boardgame that was popular in ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>So if blackjack isn’t the original gambling game, what is? It’s possible that there was no one original gambling game and that different games developed independently in different parts of the world. However, this is just a hypothesis and further research is needed to determine exactly how gambling evolved over time.</p>

Hidden among the ruins, they found several well-preserved examples of a game that appears to be blackjack.</p>
<p>The find is shedding new light on the gaming habits of the famed civilization. While it was already known that Egyptians enjoyed games of chance, this is the first concrete evidence of blackjack being played in ancient times.</p>
<p>What’s even more interesting is that the game seems to have been played with some sort of variant of the modern deck of cards. This suggests that the origins of blackjack may be much older than previously thought.</p>
<p>The discovery is sure to reignite interest in this classic casino game and provides a unique insight into how it was enjoyed by our ancestors millennia ago.</p>
