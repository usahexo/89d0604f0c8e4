<p>The 34-year-old Las Vegas resident, who has already won more than $1 million in “Jeopardy!” prize money, made a large wager on the Israeli team last week in anticipation of their matchup against Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid in this Saturday’s EuroLeague Final.</p>
<p>“Maccabi is a huge underdog, but I think they can pull it off,” Holzhauer said in a recent interview with ESPN. “I’m putting all my eggs in that basket.”</p>
<p>Holzhauer wagered more than $10,000 on Maccabi Rishon LeZion to win, making it one of the largest bets ever placed on European basketball. His faith in the Israeli team is based largely on their upset victory over CSKA Moscow in the semifinal round, which he believes could be a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>“CSKA was the clear favorite and Maccabi pulled off the upset,” Holzhauer said. “That kind of upset always gives underdogs like Maccabi a lot of momentum.”</p>
<p>Maccabi Rishon LeZion is considered an longshot to win the EuroLeague championship, with odds of 50-1 according to online sportsbook Bet365. But with Holzhauer’s backing, they just might have a chance.</p>
<h1 id="James-Holzhauer-Doubles-His-Money-Betting-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion"><a href="#James-Holzhauer-Doubles-His-Money-Betting-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion" class="headerlink" title="James Holzhauer Doubles His Money Betting on Maccabi Rishon LeZion"></a>James Holzhauer Doubles His Money Betting on Maccabi Rishon LeZion</h1><p>; James Holzhauer, a 34-year-old professional gambler from Naperville, Illinois, has doubled his money betting on Maccabi Rishon LeZion to win the EuroLeague Championship.</p>
<p>Holzhauer placed a $10,000 bet on the Israeli team at 10-1 odds and is now sitting on a $20,000 payday after they advanced to the Finals.</p>
<p>“I’m very confident in Maccabi’s ability to win it all,” said Holzhauer. “They’ve been playing great basketball all season long and I’m excited to see them take home the championship.”</p>
<p>Maccabi Rishon LeZion faces off against Olympiacos Piraeus in the Finals, with the first game taking place tomorrow night in Athens.</p>
<h1 id="James-Holzhauer-Solidifies-Himself-as-a-Leading-Betting-Pro-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion"><a href="#James-Holzhauer-Solidifies-Himself-as-a-Leading-Betting-Pro-on-Maccabi-Rishon-LeZion" class="headerlink" title="James Holzhauer Solidifies Himself as a Leading Betting Pro on Maccabi Rishon LeZion"></a>James Holzhauer Solidifies Himself as a Leading Betting Pro on Maccabi Rishon LeZion</h1><p>It is no secret that James Holzhauer is a betting pro. The 34-year old American has made a name for himself by winning big money on quiz shows such as “Jeopardy!”. Holzhauer is now looking to transfer his skills over to the world of professional basketball, and he has chosen Maccabi Rishon LeZion as his team of choice.</p>
<p>Rishon LeZion is a relatively small Israeli club, but they have been steadily improving in recent years. They reached the playoffs for the first time ever in 2018, and they are currently gunning for a place in this year’s Final Four. Holzhauer is obviously confident in their ability to make it all the way, and he has placed some very large bets on them doing so.</p>
<p>One sports book in particular has given him some very good odds on his wagers. If Maccabi Rishon LeZion manage to win the championship this year, Holzhauer will net himself a cool $1 million payday. That’s an awful lot of money to bet on a team that most people have never even heard of, but Holzhauer is obviously confident in their ability to succeed.</p>
<p>So far, he has been proven correct on several occasions. Rishon LeZion have exceeded expectations this season, and they currently sit in second place in their league standings. There is still a long way to go before the playoffs begin, but Holzhauer will be hoping that they can maintain their current form until then.</p>

Holzhauer placed a bet on Maccabi Rishon LeZion to win EuroLeague and walked away with a $ profit after they came up short against Real Madrid in the championship game over the weekend.</p>
<p>“Maccabi was a bit of an underdog in their matchup against Real Madrid,” said Holzhauer. “I thought they had a real chance to pull off the upset and I was happy to see them make it as far as they did.”</p>
<p>Holzhauer is no stranger to sports betting, having turned a $30 investment into over $1 million in profits over the past five years. Much of that success has come from wagering on basketball games, both in the United States and abroad. In fact, he credits his knowledge of European basketball leagues for his big win on “Jeopardy!” earlier this year.</p>
<p>“The EuroLeague is one of the most underrated leagues in the world,” said Holzhauer. “There are a lot of great teams and players competing in it each season, so I’m always looking to place a few bets on those games.”</p>
<p>While he didn’t come out ahead in this particular instance, Holzhauer is already eyeing up his next opportunity to make some money by betting on sports. And considering his track record thus far, it’s probably best not to bet against him.</p>
