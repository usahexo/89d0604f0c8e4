In this article, we’re going to give you some tips and tricks on how to beat the casino in Yooka-Laylee.</p>
<p>First of all, let’s take a look at the different games that you can play in the casino, and what you need to do in order to win:</p>
<p>Poker – In Poker, you need to make the best five-card hand possible using the two cards in your hand and the five community cards on the table. To win, simply have the best hand out of all of the players at the table.</p>
<p>Slot machines – In Slot machines, you need to match three symbols in a row in order to win. To increase your chances of winning, try to hold down the button as long as possible so that the reels spin for longer.</p>
<p>Darts – In Darts, you need to throwing three darts at a dartboard and score as many points as possible. The closer your darts are to the centre of the board, the more points they’ll score.</p>
<p>Games of chance – In Games of Chance, such as Roulette and Blackjack, your aim is to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 than they are. If your total goes over 21 (known as a bust), then you lose automatically.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play each game in the casino, here are some tips and tricks on how to beat them:</p>
<p>Poker – In Poker, try not to discard any good cards early on in the game. Keep track of which cards have been played already, so that you can make better decisions about which ones to keep. Also, try not to bet too much money early on – wait until you have a good hand before betting big.</p>
<p>Slot machines – To maximise your chances of winning on Slot machines, hold down the button for as long as possible so that more spins take place. This will increase your chances of getting matching symbols across all three reels.</p>
<p>Darts – When throwing darts at a dartboard, try and aim for either the bullseye or one of the outer rings for higher scores. Remember that leg shots are worth more than shots from directly above or below!</p>
<p>Games of chance – In Blackjack and Roulette especially, it’s important to use strategy if you want stand a chance against the dealer. For Blackjack specifically: always hit when your hand is below 17; stand when your hand is 17 or higher; double down when you have 11 or more; and split pairs when they consist of two identical cards. For Roulette: bet on red or black if you want even odds; bet on a particular number if you’re feeling lucky; or place outside bets if you want more chances of winning but smaller payouts</p>
