        <h1 id="San-Manuel-Tribe-Expands-Casino-Empire-to-Atlantic-City"><a href="#San-Manuel-Tribe-Expands-Casino-Empire-to-Atlantic-City" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel Tribe Expands Casino Empire to Atlantic City"></a>San Manuel Tribe Expands Casino Empire to Atlantic City</h1><p>After years of unsuccessful attempts to open a casino in Atlantic City, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has finally found success. The tribe’s new $225 million casino opened this week, just in time for the holidays.</p>
<p>The venue is the first Las Vegas-style casino on the East Coast, and it is already proving to be a popular attraction. More than 1,000 people lined up on opening day to take part in the festivities.</p>
<p>“This is a very exciting time for us,” said San Manuel Chairman Robert Salgado. “We are proud to bring our world-class gaming experience to the East Coast and we believe that Atlantic City is the perfect location for us.”</p>
<p>The new casino is being marketed as an “adult playground,” with a wide range of gambling options, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There are also 63 luxury hotel rooms on site, making it the perfect place to stay for visitors looking to enjoy a getaway weekend in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The opening of the casino has been met with mixed reactions from local residents and business owners. Some are concerned that it will cannibalize business from other casinos in town, while others are hopeful that it will bring new life to the struggling city.</p>
<p>Regardless of how things ultimately play out, there’s no doubt that the San Manuel Tribe has made a big investment in Atlantic City and they appear to be in it for the long haul.</p>
<h1 id="San-Manuel-Casino-Joins-the-Growing-List-of-Atlantic-City-Gaming-Properties"><a href="#San-Manuel-Casino-Joins-the-Growing-List-of-Atlantic-City-Gaming-Properties" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel Casino Joins the Growing List of Atlantic City Gaming Properties"></a>San Manuel Casino Joins the Growing List of Atlantic City Gaming Properties</h1><p>After a long and arduous process, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has finally been granted permission to open a casino in Atlantic City. The new venue, to be named San Manuel Casino, is set to join an increasingly competitive market that already includes eleven other casinos.</p>
<p>The tribe initially sought to open a casino in Atlantic City back in 2006, but was met with heavy resistance from other operators in the city. After years of legal battles and lobbying efforts, the tribe was finally granted permission by New Jersey governor Chris Christie in early 2016.</p>
<p>The new casino is expected to generate around 1,000 jobs and have an annual economic impact of $300 million. It will also contribute millions of dollars in new revenue to the state government.</p>
<p>“This is a great victory not just for the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, but for all of Atlantic City,” said tribe chairman Robert Smith. “We are committed to creating a world-class gaming and entertainment experience that will be a boon to the local economy.”</p>
<p>Construction on the new casino is scheduled to begin later this year, with an opening target of late 2018 or early 2019.</p>
<h1 id="San-Manuel-Puts-its-Stamp-on-Atlantic-City-Gaming-with-a-New-Casino-Resort"><a href="#San-Manuel-Puts-its-Stamp-on-Atlantic-City-Gaming-with-a-New-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel Puts its Stamp on Atlantic City Gaming with a New Casino Resort"></a>San Manuel Puts its Stamp on Atlantic City Gaming with a New Casino Resort</h1><p>Officially open as of Wednesday, November 14, 2018, the $700 million San Manuel casino resort in Atlantic City is the newest and most lavish gambling destination to grace the east coast. Boasting 1,600 gaming machines and 120 table games on its 125,000 square feet of gaming floor space, the new property is also home to a 52-story hotel tower with 642 guest rooms and suites, as well as a 12-acre amusement park.</p>
<p>The opening of San Manuel comes as the industry in Atlantic City rebounds from years of decline. The market has been struggling since Pennsylvania legalized slots gambling in 2004, followed by New Jersey in 2013. Atlantic City’s casinos have seen their share of the U.S. gambling market fall from about 50 percent a decade ago to 26 percent last year. However, recently there has been renewed interest in the city with Hard Rock International opening its own $2.4 billion casino resort in June this year, and Ocean Resort Casino unveiling its own $175 million renovation project in September.</p>
<p>“Atlantic City is coming back,” said San Manuel Chairman Lee Amaitis at the grand opening celebration earlier this month. “It’s been on a roller coaster for 10 years or so but it looks like it’s starting to come back.”</p>
<h1 id="The-Amenities-at-San-Manuel-Casino-Resort-Make-it-One-of-a-Kind"><a href="#The-Amenities-at-San-Manuel-Casino-Resort-Make-it-One-of-a-Kind" class="headerlink" title="The Amenities at San Manuel Casino Resort Make it One of a Kind"></a>The Amenities at San Manuel Casino Resort Make it One of a Kind</h1><p>In addition to its world-class gaming facilities, San Manuel also offers guests plenty of other amenities to enjoy. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A luxurious spa and wellness center with 18 treatment rooms, plus a salon and barber shop</p>
</li>
<li><p>A fitness center with cardio and weight equipment, as well as an indoor pool and Jacuzzi</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multiple restaurants and bars including fine dining establishments such as Meeting House and BC Prime Steakhouse, plus a food court with quick bites like pizza, sushi and tacos</p>
</li>
<li><p>An event center with 35,000 square feet of space that can accommodate up to 4,000 guests for meetings or special occasions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Retail outlets selling everything from designer clothes and jewelry to souvenirs and casino gear</p>

The $300 million deal is set to close in early 2020, and will make the San Manuel gaming establishment the largest operator of casinos in the US.</p>
<p>The Atlantic City Casino Resort has been closed since September 2018, when it was one of five casinos to be shut down as part of New Jersey’s efforts to revitalize the ailing casino industry. At the time of its closure, the Atlantic City Casino Resort was one of the most popular casinos in New Jersey, with over 2,000 slot machines and more than 100 table games.</p>
<p>The San Manuel Indian Gaming Establishment is no stranger to success, with its flagship casino in California ranking among the top 25 earners in the US. The purchase of the Atlantic City Casino Resort is expected to give the San Manuel Indian Gaming Establishment a foothold in the East Coast market, where gambling revenues have been declining in recent years.</p>
<p>Industry analysts are divided on how this move will play out. Some believe that it will trigger a wave of consolidation within the casino industry as struggling operators attempt to keep up with the San Manuel Indian Gaming Establishment. Others argue that this move could be disastrous for the San Manuel Indian Gaming Establishment, given that Atlantic City is in decline and other East Coast casinos are expanding their operations.</p>
<p>Only time will tell which side is right, but one thing is for sure: this move is sure to have a major impact on the casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="San-Manuel-Tribe-and-Majestic-Star-Casinos-Partner-in-New-Atlantic-City-Casino-Resort"><a href="#San-Manuel-Tribe-and-Majestic-Star-Casinos-Partner-in-New-Atlantic-City-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel Tribe and Majestic Star Casinos Partner in New Atlantic City Casino Resort"></a>San Manuel Tribe and Majestic Star Casinos Partner in New Atlantic City Casino Resort</h1><p>The San Manuel Tribe of southern California and Majestic Star Casinos, owners of two Indiana casino resorts, are partnering to open a new casino resort in Atlantic City. The new resort will be called the Majestic Star II and is expected to open in late 2018.</p>
<p>The tribe has been looking for a partner to help them open a casino resort in Atlantic City for some time now. After announcing plans to build their own casino resort, they were quickly approached by a number of potential partners. In the end, the tribe chose Majestic Star Casinos because of their experience in the casino industry and their shared commitment to delivering a high-quality product.</p>
<p>The new casino resort will be built on the Boardwalk and will feature 500 hotel rooms, a spa, several restaurants, and of course, a large casino floor. The tribe is also planning on building an entertainment complex that will include a movie theater and conference center.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be partnering with the San Manuel Tribe,” said Greg Giuffra, CEO of Majestic Star Casinos. “This is going to be an amazing project and we can’t wait to get started.”</p>
<p>The tribe has already started construction on the new resort and anticipates that it will create 1,500 jobs once it’s up and running.</p>

The gunfire and explosions were so realistic that the cast and crew had to take cover.</p>
<p>“It was very intense,” said director Ben Affleck. “We were doing takes and all of a sudden there was this gunfire and people were screaming and running for cover.”</p>
<p>Live by Night is set in the prohibition era and features a shootout between gangsters and police officers at a casino. To create the effect, the filmmakers used forced perspective shots and digital effects.</p>
<p>In order to make the gunfire more realistic, they used blanks instead of bullets. This resulted in some injuries to the cast and crew.</p>
<p>“We had a few people get hit by shrapnel,” said producer Dylan Clark. “It was pretty scary.”</p>
<p>Despite the danger, the cast and crew were enthusiastic about making the film.</p>
<p>“It was a lot of fun,” said actor Siobhan Fallon Hogan. “We got to run around and shoot guns.”</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that Affleck has filmed a scene involving alcohol. In 2013’s Gone Girl, he played a recovering alcoholic who fell off the wagon.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that Affleck is no stranger to alcohol, having battled alcoholism himself in the past. In fact, he credits Alcoholics Anonymous with helping him to stay sober.</p>
<p>So it’s not surprising that he would want to include such scenes in his films. Alcoholism is a very real problem for many people and it’s important to show accurate portrayals of it on screen.</p>
<p>Affleck has said that he wants to use his films as a way to tell “human stories” and to provide social commentary on important issues. And what could be more important than alcoholism and its impact on families and communities?</p>
<p>Alcoholism is often viewed as shameful and embarrassing, but it’s important for people to see that it’s a real disease that can affect anyone. Films like Live by Night can help to raise awareness about this issue and help people who are struggling with alcoholism get the help they need.</p>

<p>The new Ben Affleck film, ‘Live by Night,’ had its world premiere at the Mann Village Theatre in Los Angeles on January 10. The film is set in the 1920s and 1930s and features several scenes set in a casino. In order to accurately recreate a 1920s-era casino atmosphere, the production team chose to shoot the casino scenes at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“We knew that we needed an environment that was going to be realistic and help transport our audience back in time,” said producer Jennifer Todd. “The Rivers Casino perfectly recreated the look and feel of a 1920s casino, so it was the obvious choice for us.”</p>
<p>In preparation for the shoot, the Rivers Casino closed its doors to the public for two days and underwent a massive transformation. The casino floor was re-created with period-correct gaming tables and accessories, and even the employees were dressed in period costumes.</p>
<p>“It was really fun getting into character and dressing up,” said employee Brittany Beamer. “Everyone on staff was excited to be a part of this movie.”</p>
<p>The cast and crew spent two days filming at the casino, and according to Affleck, it was a great experience. “It was really fun shooting those scenes at the Rivers Casino,” said Affleck. “The staff were all so helpful and accommodating, and it was great being able to film in such a beautiful setting.”</p>
<p>‘Live by Night’ is scheduled for release on January 13.</p>

<p>The cast and crew were on the scene from mid-January through early February, filming both inside the casino and out on the streets of downtown Schenectady. The mobster drama is based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, and also stars Sienna Miller and Zoe Saldana.</p>
<p>According to producer Jennifer Davisson Killoran, Schenectady was an ideal location for the film. “We needed a gritty city with buildings that date back to the 1920s,” she said. “Schenectady has all of that, plus great support from the community and Mayor Gary McCarthy.”</p>
<p>Mayor McCarthy was thrilled to have the production in town. “This is a great opportunity to showcase our city on a national stage,” he said. “The cast and crew have been wonderful to work with, and we can’t wait to see the finished product.”</p>
<p>Additional scenes for the movie were shot at various locations in Albany and Troy. The film is expected to be released in late 2016.</p>

<li>Ben Affleck to direct and star in ‘Live by Night’; new movie set in the 1920s and based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane </li>
<li>Filming for ‘Live by Night’ underway, with scenes shot at Big Fish Casino in Biloxi, MS</li>
</ul>
<p>BILOXI, MS - The latest film from Oscar-winning actor-director Ben Affleck is currently being filmed in Biloxi and surrounding areas. The movie, “Live by Night,” is set in the 1920s and stars Affleck in the lead role.</p>
<p>While tight-lipped about specific details of the movie, representatives from Warner Bros. have confirmed that some casino scenes were shot this week at Big Fish Casino in Biloxi. It’s unclear at this point whether those scenes will make it into the final cut of the film.</p>
<p>“Live by Night” tells the story of Joe Coughlin (Affleck), a son of a Boston police captain who turns his back on his strict upbringing and enters into a life of crime. Along the way, he falls in love with Tess (Sienna Miller), a beautiful woman whose husband happens to be one of Joe’s arch-enemies.</p>
<p>The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, author also responsible for “Mystic River” and “Shutter Island.” Lehane has described “Live by Night” as a “gangster epic,” and with its 1920s setting, it should provide plenty of interesting visual elements for audiences to enjoy.</p>
<p>Ben Affleck has already had success as a director with films such as “The Town” and “Gone Baby Gone.” He won an Academy Award for Best Picture in 2013 for his work on “Argo.”</p>
<p>“Live by Night” is scheduled for release in theaters on October 7, 2016.</p>

Most of these were slot machines, but there were also some table games and a few video poker titles. The site was owned and operated by a company calledMediaLive International Inc.</p>
<p>At that time, circa casino didn’t offer any bonuses or promotions to its players. In fact, the only thing that set it apart from other online casinos was its small selection of games. This may have been one reason why it failed to gain much traction among online gamers.</p>
<p>In addition, the site’s design was quite basic and didn’t really stand out from the crowd. This likely contributed to its lack of popularity as well. Overall, circa casino seems to have been quite unremarkable before the release of Samurai Girl game.</p>

The people living in this land were very lucky because they got to experience the amazing phenomenon that is casino. The first casino appeared around the same time as samurai girl games, and it was a huge hit! There were people from all walks of life who were drawn to the excitement of playing games and trying their luck at winning big.</p>
<p>There were many different types of casino games available, but the most popular by far were the slot machines. These machines allowed players to win big payouts if they hit the right combination of symbols. Slot machines became so popular that many casinos began to specialize in them, and today there are entire casinos devoted to nothing but slots.</p>
<p>In addition to slots, there were also table games like blackjack and poker which were very popular among players. These games usually involved betting money on the outcome of a game, and the person who won the most money at the end was declared the winner. Some casinos offered tournaments where players could compete against each other for big prizes.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, casino was a very exciting place to be and it quickly grew into a huge industry. Thousands of people flocked to casino every day in search of excitement and fortune, and many of them managed to find both. Over time, casino has become one of the most popular ways to pass the time, and it show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Thanks for reading about the history of casino!</p>

There were much fewer options for players, and the games were much simpler. In particular, the slot machines were much less complex, and there were far fewer of them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the casino scene was dominated by men. There were very few women in the casinos, and they were typically not taken seriously by the other players. This changed with Samurai Girl Game, which opened up the casino scene to women and brought a new level of complexity to the games.</p>

The first casino was reportedly opened in Venice, Italy in 1638. However, the casino industry as we know it today started in Las Vegas in the early 1940s.</p>
<p>Casinos have come a long way since then. They are now bigger and more flashy than ever before. In fact, some casinos are so large that they can easily rival a small town.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with all the glitz and glamour comes a fair bit of controversy. There have been numerous reports of casino scams, cheating and other illegal activities.</p>
<p>Despite the bad press, casinos continue to be one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. People love to gamble and to experience the high-octane atmosphere of a casino.</p>

        <h1 id="George-Clooney-Will-Be-the-Casino-Owner-in-the-Upcoming-‘Oceans-Eleven’-Reboot"><a href="#George-Clooney-Will-Be-the-Casino-Owner-in-the-Upcoming-‘Oceans-Eleven’-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="George Clooney Will Be the Casino Owner in the Upcoming ‘Oceans Eleven’ Reboot"></a>George Clooney Will Be the Casino Owner in the Upcoming ‘Oceans Eleven’ Reboot</h1><p>The upcoming reboot of the classic Rat Pack movie, Oceans Eleven, will have George Clooney stepping into the role of casino owner. This isn’t a new role for Clooney; he has starred in various films as a casino owner or operator. In Ocean’s Eleven, he will play the part of Terry Benedict who owns the casinos in both Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast is still being finalized but there are already rumors that Matt Damon and Brad Pitt will be returning to their roles from the original film. The film is set to begin filming in early 2019 and is expected to be released later that year.</p>
<p>This reboot is just one in a long line of films being produced by Warner Bros. as they look to capitalize on the popular Oceans franchise. They have also announced plans for an Oceans Eight spin-off movie which will focus on Danny Ocean’s sister Debbie (played by Sandra Bullock) and her team of female thieves.</p>
<p>This isn’t Clooney’s only upcoming project; he is also set to star in a Hulu miniseries based on the life of Joseph Heller called Catch-22. The series is set to air in 2019 and will be produced by Paramount Television.</p>
<h1 id="George-Clooney-Plans-to-Continue-His-Role-as-Casino-Owner-in-Upcoming-Movies"><a href="#George-Clooney-Plans-to-Continue-His-Role-as-Casino-Owner-in-Upcoming-Movies" class="headerlink" title="George Clooney Plans to Continue His Role as Casino Owner in Upcoming Movies"></a>George Clooney Plans to Continue His Role as Casino Owner in Upcoming Movies</h1><p>George Clooney is an American actor, film director, producer, and screenwriter. He has received three Golden Globe Awards for his work as an actor and two Academy Awards—one for acting and the other for producing.<br>In recent news, Clooney plans to continue his role as casino owner in upcoming movies. Clooney has been seen around town with a different casino owner’s hat on.<br>When asked by a reporter what he was up to, Clooney grinned and said, “Just another day at the office.”<br>This isn’t the first time Clooney has played a casino owner on the big screen. His first portrayal was in the 2013 movie The Monuments Men. Clooney is no stranger to playing interesting characters; he’s often called upon to take on roles that are multi-layered and complex.<br>Besides acting, Clooney also produces films. In this arena, he’s had just as much success as he has with acting. In fact, his production company Casamigos won an Oscar in 2017 for best documentary short subject.<br>Casamigos was founded by Clooney and friends Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman in 2013. The company produces tequila under the same name.<br>It will be interesting to see how Clooney’s new movie fares at the box office; especially since he’s attached to it as both actor and producer.</p>
<h1 id="Could-George-Clooney’s-Role-as-Casino-Owner-be-in-Jeopardy"><a href="#Could-George-Clooney’s-Role-as-Casino-Owner-be-in-Jeopardy" class="headerlink" title="Could George Clooney’s Role as Casino Owner be in Jeopardy?"></a>Could George Clooney’s Role as Casino Owner be in Jeopardy?</h1><p>It’s been a little more than a year since George Clooney and partners officially opened the doors of their new casino, the Palazzo, in Las Vegas. The luxurious casino resort has been doing well, but new allegations could mean bad news for Clooney’s business venture.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating the Palazzo for possible securities violations. Specifically, investigators are looking into whether the casino was improperly promoting its ownership by Clooney and other celebrity investors.</p>
<p>The SEC is said to be particularly interested in a promotional video that was released shortly before the Palazzo opened. The video features Clooney and other celebrities discussing their investment in the casino. It’s not clear what, if any, laws were violated with the promotion, but it could spell trouble for Clooney and his partners.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Clooney has been embroiled in a legal battle over his casino. Last year, he and his partners were sued by workers at the Palazzo who claimed they were not being paid fair wages. The workers eventually reached a settlement with the casino owners.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will happen with the latest SEC investigation, but it could spell trouble for Clooney’s role as casino owner.</p>
<h1 id="What-Caused-George-Clooney-to-Quit-His-Role-as-Casino-Owner"><a href="#What-Caused-George-Clooney-to-Quit-His-Role-as-Casino-Owner" class="headerlink" title="What Caused George Clooney to Quit His Role as Casino Owner?"></a>What Caused George Clooney to Quit His Role as Casino Owner?</h1><p>A little over a year ago, George Clooney announced he was quitting his role as casino owner. At the time, no one knew why. But now we may have an answer.</p>
<p>Last week, it was revealed that the state of Ohio had revoked the casino’s license because of financial improprieties. Clooney and his partners had been accused of skimming money from the casino’s coffers.</p>
<p>This may not have come as a surprise to Clooney. He has long been known for being a very savvy businessman. It’s likely that he realized the casino was in trouble and decided to cut his losses.</p>
<p> Clooney has always been a risk taker, but he’s also a very smart one. He knows when to pull out of a venture that isn’t going well. And he’s never been shy about admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Clooney has had an incredible career, and this latest setback is not likely to change that. He is still one of the most popular actors in Hollywood and his career shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<h1 id="George-Clooney-The-New-Casino-Owner-for-‘Oceans-Eleven’"><a href="#George-Clooney-The-New-Casino-Owner-for-‘Oceans-Eleven’" class="headerlink" title="George Clooney: The New Casino Owner for ‘Oceans Eleven’!"></a>George Clooney: The New Casino Owner for ‘Oceans Eleven’!</h1><p>Casino fans were thrilled to hear the news that George Clooney is set to produce and star in a reboot of 2001’s ‘Oceans Eleven’. The original film, which was directed by Steven Soderbergh and starred George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts, was a box office success.</p>
<p>Clooney will be taking on the role of Danny Ocean, originally played by Pitt, in the new movie. It is not yet known whether any of the other original cast members will be returning, but with Clooney at the helm it is sure to be a hit.</p>
<p>The plot of the new movie is being kept under wraps, but it is thought that it will follow the same basic premise as the original. That is, a group of criminals team up to rob a casino.</p>
<p>Given Clooney’s experience as an actor and producer, it is safe to say that this new ‘Oceans Eleven’ movie is in good hands. In fact, he has already proven himself to be a successful casino owner – his latest venture, Casamigos Tequila, was recently sold for $1 billion!</p>

<h1 id="How-much-money-does-they-make"><a href="#How-much-money-does-they-make" class="headerlink" title="How much money does they make?"></a>How much money does they make?</h1><p>A lot of people, when they think of the ultra-rich, they imagine people who have a lot of money. How much money do they make? is a question that may often come to mind. While there are many ways to answer this question, one way is to look at how much money the richest people in the world have.</p>
<p>According to a 2016 report by Bloomberg, Bill Gates is the richest person in the world with a net worth of $75 billion. Amancio Ortega, the founder of Inditex fashion group, which includes the retailer Zara, is second with a net worth of $67 billion. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., is third with a net worth of $60.8 billion. And Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com Inc., is fourth with a net worth of $45.2 billion.</p>
<p>These are just some examples, but it’s clear that those who are at the top of the list for wealthiest people in the world have billions and billions of dollars. So just how much money does that translate to on an annual basis? Well, if you were to divide each person’s net worth by 365 days, you would get an estimate for how much money each person makes per day. Gates’ daily income would be about $202,000; Ortega’s would be $176,000; Buffett’s would be $164,000; and Bezos’ would be $123,000.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these numbers are just estimates and do not account for things like taxes or other expenses. But it gives you an idea as to just how wealthy some of the people on this list are and how much money they make on a daily basis.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-their-net-worth"><a href="#What-is-their-net-worth" class="headerlink" title="What is their net worth?"></a>What is their net worth?</h1><p>As of July 2017, the richest person in the world is Bill Gates with a net worth of $89.9 billion. followed by Amancio Ortega with $85.3 billion and Warren Buffett with $75.6 billion. Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Carlos Slim round out the top six, with net worths of $72.8 billion, $71.3 billion, and $54.5 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>Collectively, the world’s 10 richest people are worth $426.2 billion, up from $415.4 billion in July 2016.</p>
<p>The biggest gainer this year is Zuckerberg, who has seen his net worth more than double from $34.7 billion to $71.3 billion thanks to strong performances by Facebook stock. Bezos is also doing well this year, with Amazon shares up 50%.</p>
<p>Notably absent from this year’s list are four of the world’s ten richest people in 2016: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud (net worth: $22.8 billion), Sergey Brin (net worth: $39.0 billion), Larry Page (net worth: $40.7 billion), and Lui Che Woo (net worth: $38.0 billion). All four saw their fortunes decline over the past year due to a variety of factors including lower oil prices and political instability in Saudi Arabia for Prince Alwaleed and weaker stock prices for Google parent company Alphabet Inc., for Brin and Page.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-they-do-with-all-their-money"><a href="#What-do-they-do-with-all-their-money" class="headerlink" title="What do they do with all their money?"></a>What do they do with all their money?</h1><p>Some people seem to have a lot of money, but what do they really do with it all? Do they just sit on it and stare at it, or do they use it to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>There are some people who use their money to help others. For example, there are some people who give a lot of their money to charity. They may donate to hospitals, homeless shelters, or other places that help people in need.</p>
<p>There are also some people who use their money to start their own businesses. This can help create jobs and improve the economy. People can also use their money to support causes they believe in. For example, they may donate to political campaigns or environmental organizations.</p>
<p>No matter what someone chooses to do with their money, it’s important that they do something good with it. It’s great that they have been able to accumulate so much wealth, but it would be a shame if they didn’t use it for good purposes.</p>
<h1 id="Why-are-they-so-successful"><a href="#Why-are-they-so-successful" class="headerlink" title="Why are they so successful?"></a>Why are they so successful?</h1><p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. The company’s hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, and the Apple Watch smartwatch. Its software includes the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iWork and iCloud productivity suites. Apple’s online services include the iTunes Store, the App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.</p>
<p>Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak,[10] and Ronald Wayne. The company’s first product was the Apple I personal computer kit. It was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic input&#x2F;output devices), which customers had to assemble themselves. The Apple I kits were computers designed by Jobs and Wozniak in Jobs’ parents’ garage.[11] They were manufactured by an outside company,[12] and box-shipped to San Francisco Bay Area retailers.[13]</p>
<p>The Apple II was introduced in 1977 with improved components; it featured an 8-bit microprocessor chip from MOS Technology,[14][15][16] which rendered 65 thousand colors onscreen from a palette of 16 million colors.[17][18][19] Sales increased significantly over the next few years as businesses increasingly purchased computers for use in their offices instead of using them as home consumer goods.[20] Jobs resigned from his position on September 17th 1985,[21]:193 after unsuccessfully trying to oust John Sculley as CEO but remaining on the Board of Directors,[22]:5 he served as Chairman of the Board until 1997.[23]:159 In addition to his CEO role at NeXT Computer[24], Jobs took on an advisory role at newly formed Pixar Animation Studios starting in 1986 until its acquisition by Disney in 2006 for $7.4 billion cumulated cash &amp; stock deal ($9 billion including assumption of debt).[25]:8</p>
<p>On December 3rd 1996,[26]:240 Jobs returned to become interim CEO after then-CEO Gil Amelio was fired[27]; one month later he became full-time CEO[28]. Jobs terminated all ongoing projects except for one - development of what would become known as OS X - during his tenure as CEO (1997-2011).[29]:193 On August 24th 2011 he resigned due to illness[30], handing leadership over to COO Tim Cook who ran day-to-day operations until Jobs’ death on October 5th 2011 due to pancreatic cancer.[31][32] He was survived by his wife Laurene Powell Jobs and four children: daughters Lisa Brennan-Jobs and Eve Jobs (from his first marriage), sons Reed Paul Jobs and Erin Sienna Jobs (from his second marriage), plus another child whose parentage is not public knowledge.</p>
<p>After founding NeXT Computer Inc., Steve Jobs resigned from his position there which led him back to work at Lucasfilm Ltd.’s computer graphics division which had been spun off into a new venture called Pixar Animation Studios where he became chairman of its board of directors. When Lucasfilm Ltd.’s owner decided to sell it off with Pixar being up for sale at one point also with offers from Microsoft Corporation among others before being bought by Walt Disney Productions for $7.4 billion in February 2006 spread out over an accumulation of Disney’s shares making it worth about $9 billion taking inflation into account</p>
