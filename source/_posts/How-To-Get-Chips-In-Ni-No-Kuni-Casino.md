Once at the appropriate level and after speaking with the attendant at the booth, players can then exchange their gold coins for an influx of casino chips. The amount of coins needed varies depending on how many chips are desired - 30 coins will net you 10,000 chips while 10 coins gets you just 1,000 chips.
