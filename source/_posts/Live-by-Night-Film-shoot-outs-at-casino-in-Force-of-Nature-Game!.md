#  Live by Night Film shoot outs at casino in Force of Nature Game!

The new film Live by Night is receiving rave reviews for its authenticity in depicting a casino shootout. The gunfire and explosions were so realistic that the cast and crew had to take cover.

"It was very intense," said director Ben Affleck. "We were doing takes and all of a sudden there was this gunfire and people were screaming and running for cover."

Live by Night is set in the prohibition era and features a shootout between gangsters and police officers at a casino. To create the effect, the filmmakers used forced perspective shots and digital effects.

In order to make the gunfire more realistic, they used blanks instead of bullets. This resulted in some injuries to the cast and crew.

"We had a few people get hit by shrapnel," said producer Dylan Clark. "It was pretty scary."

Despite the danger, the cast and crew were enthusiastic about making the film.

"It was a lot of fun," said actor Siobhan Fallon Hogan. "We got to run around and shoot guns."

#  Coughlin Shot Casino Scene during Live by Night Filming!

Ben Affleck was recently spotted on the set of Live by Night filming a scene in which he takes a shot in a casino.

In the scene, Affleck's character is playing blackjack and is down to his last chip. He then takes a shot of bourbon, inspired by his opponent who has been doing the same all night.

This isn't the first time that Affleck has filmed a scene involving alcohol. In 2013's Gone Girl, he played a recovering alcoholic who fell off the wagon.

It's no secret that Affleck is no stranger to alcohol, having battled alcoholism himself in the past. In fact, he credits Alcoholics Anonymous with helping him to stay sober.

So it's not surprising that he would want to include such scenes in his films. Alcoholism is a very real problem for many people and it's important to show accurate portrayals of it on screen.

Affleck has said that he wants to use his films as a way to tell "human stories" and to provide social commentary on important issues. And what could be more important than alcoholism and its impact on families and communities?

Alcoholism is often viewed as shameful and embarrassing, but it's important for people to see that it's a real disease that can affect anyone. Films like Live by Night can help to raise awareness about this issue and help people who are struggling with alcoholism get the help they need.

The Cast and Crew of 'Live by Night' film casino scenes at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh!

The new Ben Affleck film, 'Live by Night,' had its world premiere at the Mann Village Theatre in Los Angeles on January 10. The film is set in the 1920s and 1930s and features several scenes set in a casino. In order to accurately recreate a 1920s-era casino atmosphere, the production team chose to shoot the casino scenes at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh.

"We knew that we needed an environment that was going to be realistic and help transport our audience back in time," said producer Jennifer Todd. "The Rivers Casino perfectly recreated the look and feel of a 1920s casino, so it was the obvious choice for us."

In preparation for the shoot, the Rivers Casino closed its doors to the public for two days and underwent a massive transformation. The casino floor was re-created with period-correct gaming tables and accessories, and even the employees were dressed in period costumes.

"It was really fun getting into character and dressing up," said employee Brittany Beamer. "Everyone on staff was excited to be a part of this movie."

The cast and crew spent two days filming at the casino, and according to Affleck, it was a great experience. "It was really fun shooting those scenes at the Rivers Casino," said Affleck. "The staff were all so helpful and accommodating, and it was great being able to film in such a beautiful setting."

'Live by Night' is scheduled for release on January 13.

#  'Live by Night' movie filmed at the Rivers Casino!

The Rivers Casino in Schenectady was the backdrop for the filming of the new movie “Live by Night,” starring Ben Affleck, Elle Fanning, Brendan Gleeson and Chris Messina.

The cast and crew were on the scene from mid-January through early February, filming both inside the casino and out on the streets of downtown Schenectady. The mobster drama is based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, and also stars Sienna Miller and Zoe Saldana.

According to producer Jennifer Davisson Killoran, Schenectady was an ideal location for the film. “We needed a gritty city with buildings that date back to the 1920s,” she said. “Schenectady has all of that, plus great support from the community and Mayor Gary McCarthy.”

Mayor McCarthy was thrilled to have the production in town. “This is a great opportunity to showcase our city on a national stage,” he said. “The cast and crew have been wonderful to work with, and we can’t wait to see the finished product.”

Additional scenes for the movie were shot at various locations in Albany and Troy. The film is expected to be released in late 2016.

Along the way, he falls in love with Tess (Sienna Miller), a beautiful woman whose husband happens to be one of Joe's arch-enemies.

The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, author also responsible for "Mystic River" and "Shutter Island."
