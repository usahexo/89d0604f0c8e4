#  How Updike think?

John Updike, the author is known to be very perceptive about life and how people work. This can be seen through his writing as he has a way of peering into the human soul, then capturing it in words. He is not just a writer, but a commentator of life.

Updike has said that "Creativity is not a talent but a way of operating." This means that anyone can be creative if they simply find their way of operating. For Updike, this comes through observation and writing. He observes the world around him and writes about it in an insightful way.

One reason why Updike's writing is so insightful is because he takes time to understand people. He doesn't judge them, instead he tries to understand them. In an interview with The Paris Review, he said "I try to enter into the lives of my characters and see things from their point of view." By doing this, he gets inside their heads and writes about them in a way that connects with readers on a deeper level.

Updike also has a way of capturing emotions in his writing. In the same interview with The Paris Review, he said "One of the attractions of fiction for me-and for all novelists, I would presume-is the opportunity to give emotional life to points of view which we ourselves may not share." By writing from different perspectives, Updike is able to evoke a range of emotions in readers. This is what makes his writing so powerful and memorable.
