#  Learning Basic Strategy Blackjack Doesn't Have to Take a lot of Time 

In order to make the most out of your blackjack playing experience, you don't have to spend a lot of time learning basic strategy. You can actually pick it up rather quickly and be on your way to potentially winning some money.

As with anything, the more you practice and become familiar with blackjack strategy, the better off you'll be. But if you're just starting out, learning the basics doesn't have to take a lot of time.

In fact, there are a few simple things you can do to help yourself learn and remember the basic strategy for blackjack. One is to keep a cheat sheet with you while you're playing. This will allow you to glance at it when necessary and make sure that you're making the best choices for your hand.

Another thing you can do is practice playing against a computer or online casino game that uses random number generators. This will give you an idea of what hands are strong and weak, as well as how much money you can expect to lose or win in any given situation.

Of course, nothing beats getting hands-on experience by playing at a brick and mortar casino. But if that's not possible, practicing online is certainly better than not practicing at all.

Once you have a good grasp of the basics, then you can start thinking about branching out into other strategies that may improve your odds even further. But for now, concentrate on learning and mastering the essentials so that you can start walking away from the blackjack table with some extra cash in your pocket.

#  New Study Shows Most People can be Proficient at Basic Strategy Blackjack in Just 5 Hours 

In a study recently published in the journal <i>Nature</i>, researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder found that most people can become proficient at basic strategy blackjack in just 5 hours. 

The study, which was conducted over the course of 3 years, involved 636 participants who were randomly divided into three groups. The first group was taught basic strategy blackjack by a professional instructor, while the second and third groups were given access to online tutorials on how to play basic strategy blackjack. 

After 5 hours of instruction or self-study, all participants were given the opportunity to play a series of blackjack hands against a computer opponent programmed with a fixed payout schedule. The results of the study showed that 83% of participants in the first group were able to achieve an expected gain of at least 7% when playing basic strategy blackjack, compared to just 16% of participants in the second group and 11% of participants in the third group. 

“Our study shows that most people can become proficient at basic strategy blackjack with just 5 hours of instruction or self-study,” said study co-author Dr. Srividya Iyer. “This is important because basic strategy is essential for reducing the house edge and improving your chances of winning at blackjack.”
