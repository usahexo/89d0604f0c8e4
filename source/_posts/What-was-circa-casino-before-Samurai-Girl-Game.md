#  What was circa casino before Samurai Girl Game?

Around the time the Samurai Girl game was released, circa casino was a small site with around 50 different games. Most of these were slot machines, but there were also some table games and a few video poker titles. The site was owned and operated by a company calledMediaLive International Inc.

At that time, circa casino didn't offer any bonuses or promotions to its players. In fact, the only thing that set it apart from other online casinos was its small selection of games. This may have been one reason why it failed to gain much traction among online gamers.

In addition, the site's design was quite basic and didn't really stand out from the crowd. This likely contributed to its lack of popularity as well. Overall, circa casino seems to have been quite unremarkable before the release of Samurai Girl game.
