Maccabi Rishon LeZion is looking to make it back to the top this year with a new coach and young roster. The team has been in rebuilding mode for the past few years, and now they are looking to take the next step.

The team has a lot of promise with young players like Lior Eliyahu and Tomer Tzur. They also have some veterans on the team, including guard Jon Scheyer. Coach Ariel Beit Halachmi is hoping to use all of this talent to lead the team back to victory.

One of the biggest challenges that Maccabi Rishon LeZion will face this year is qualifying for the Euroleague. They finished in sixth place in the Israeli Basketball Premier League last year, which was just not good enough. As a result, they will need to do well in their preseason games if they want to make it into Europeâ€™s top basketball competition.

There is no question that Maccabi Rishon LeZion has the potential to be a great team this year. They will need to work hard and overcome some obstacles, but there is no doubt that they can do it.

In bilateral ties, the stronger side is expected to win more games. However, this is not always the case in basketball. Maccabi Rishon LeZion are in for a tough season as they attempt to defend their title against top Israeli clubs. The players who will lead them to glory have yet to be determined.

One player who is likely to make a big impact this season is Devin Ebanks. The 25-year-old was signed by the club in the offseason and brings with him experience playing in both the NBA and Europe. He averaged over 9 points per game last season while playing for Bayern Munich and will be looking to improve on that this year. Ebanks has already scored twice in preseason games, so he looks ready to take on the challenge.

Another player who could be key for Rishon LeZion is American guard Curtis Jerrells. He had an impressive season last year with Hapoel Tel Aviv, averaging over 16 points and 5 assists per game. Jerrells will be looking to continue that form this season and help his new team to victory.

There are also several talented Israeli players who will be looking to make their mark this season. Guy Pnini is a veteran guard who has been with the club since 2009 and will be looking to lead from the front. Other players such as Sylven Landesberg and Arel Ben-Sasson will also need to perform if Rishon LeZion are going to succeed this year.

3) The team is already solid. Maccabi Rishon LeZion has some good players on their roster, including Dawid Halpern, Sylven Landesberg, and Guy Pnini. Coach Blatt should be able to build on what they have already achieved and help them reach even greater heights.
