#  170 Means Serious Business for Panathinaikos

The basketball game between Greek powerhouse Panathinaikos and Czech side CEZ Nymburk last Wednesday was already a highly anticipated match. But it took on a whole new meaning for PAO when news broke that their main scorer, Dimitris Itoudis, was out with an injury.

Coach Giannis Sfairopoulos had to do some serious shuffling of his lineup, moving Nick Calathes to point guard and inserting youngster Kostas Papanikolaou into the starting five. The changes clearly didn't faze the home team, as they handily defeated CEZ 98-70.

But it was more than just the score that made this victory so impressive. Coming into the game without their top scorer, Panathinaikos showed an amazing team spirit and Meszaros-like discipline on both ends of the court. This is a sign that they are ready to make a serious run at the Euroleague championship this year.

170 (the number of points PAO scored against CEZ) Means Serious Business for Panathinaikos

#  170 Is a Huge Milestone for Panathinaikos

The long-awaited return of Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Panathinaikos basketball club was finally realized on January 9, as the team faced Olympiacos in Athens. Despite losing 68-74, Antetokounmpo's fans were thrilled to see him take the court again in his beloved green and white jersey.

The young player had taken a break from basketball to focus on his professional development, spending time with the Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA. His return to Greece was anxiously awaited not only by fans of Panathinaikos, but also by followers of European and international basketball.

On January 11, 170 days after he left for the United States, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored his first point for Panathinaikos in a Euroleague game against ALBA Berlin. The match took place in Munich, Germany and ended with a victory for Panathinaikos 73-64. This was an important win not only because it was their first in this year's Euroleague, but because it also meant they qualified for the next round.

170 is an important number for Panathinaikos both historically and symbolically. It is the amount of days between Giannis Antetokounmpo's departure from Greece and his triumphant return. It is also the number of victories that Panathinaikos needs in order to become Greek champions for an unprecedented 20th time.

#  170 Is a Major Achievement for Panathinaikos

On Saturday, Panathinaikos marked an important milestone with a convincing 0-3 win over PAS Giannina. This was the club’s 170th win in the Superleague, having made their debut back in 1959.

What made this victory all the more special was that it came against one of their biggest rivals. Olympiacos are second only to Panathinaikos when it comes to Superleague titles and this is always a fixture which is closely followed by fans of both clubs.

The result was also particularly sweet for Panathinaikos as it helped them to close the gap on the current leaders, AEK Athens. They now trail by just two points with 11 games remaining in the season.

There is no question that this is a very talented Panathinaikos side, but they will need to maintain their good form if they are to catch AEK and lift the trophy at the end of the campaign.

One player who has been crucial to their success so far is Argentine striker Diego Perotti. The 28-year-old has been in excellent form this season, scoring six goals in 16 league appearances.

He was once again on target on Saturday, scoring his side’s opening goal after just eight minutes. This strike put him level with Giannis Kotsiras as Panathinaikos’s all-time top scorer in the Superleague.

Perotti could well be key to his side’s chances of winning the title this season and he will be looking to add to his tally in the coming weeks.

#  170 Is a Proud Moment for Panathinaikos

The 1-0 victory over Larissa, on February 11th, was an important win for Panathinaikos. This specific result lifted the Greens off of the relegation zone, and gave them a bit of breathing room as they continue to battle for their place in the Super League.

 170 has been a bittersweet number for Panathinaikos. Exactly 170 days ago, on September 24th, the club announced that it had parted ways with manager Marinos Ouzounidis. The decision to sack Ouzounidis – who had been in charge since March 2017 – raised quite a few eyebrows, as he was generally considered to be a successful manager.

Nonetheless, the club moved forward and appointed Alberto Malesani as their new manager. The Italian coach had some experience in Greek football, having managed AEK Athens in the 2010-11 season.

Malesani’s appointment was not well-received by everyone, but he did have his share of supporters as well. One of his biggest tasks was to turn around the team’s fortunes and lead them to safety.

And that is precisely what he did. Under his guidance, Panathinaikos achieved some crucial victories which kept them afloat in the league standings. Some of these wins include: a 3-1 victory over outsiders Asteras Tripoli, a 2-0 win over rivals PAOK Salonika, and most importantly – the 1-0 victory over Larissa mentioned earlier.

This recent win was especially sweet for Panathinaikos fans because it came against one of their biggest rivals. The fact that they secured all three points against Larissa – despite playing with 10 men for almost the entire second half – made this victory even more impressive.

As a result of this win, Panathinaikos now find themselves in 14th place in the Super League standings with 29 points. They are still not out of danger yet, but this recent victory has given them a much-needed boost as they continue to fight for survival.

#  170 Represents the Hard Work and Dedication of Panathinaikos


The 2017-2018 season has been one of the most difficult in recent memory for Panathinaikos. The club finds itself in 6th place in the Superleague Greece, barely hanging onto a spot in Europe. This disappointing position is a far cry from the club’s 3rd-place finish last year.

A large part of the team’s struggles can be attributed to injuries. Key players such as Stefanos Kotsolis, Tiago Pires, and Luka Milovic have all spent extended time on the sidelines. The team has also been hampered by inconsistent play, which was summed up perfectly by their 4-4 draw against lowly OFI Crete.

Despite these challenges, the club has remained united and fighting until the end. One player who has epitomized this spirit is Brazilian midfielder 170 (real name: Matheus).

170 arrived at Panathinaikos this season after spending 3 years at PAOK Salonika. He made an immediate impact with some stellar performances, including a goal and an assist in his debut against Asteras Tripoli. His hard work and dedication have been a key factor in Panathinaikos’s resurgence in recent games.

170’s contribution was never more evident than in Panathinaikos’s crucial match against Xanthi FC. With the score tied at 1-1 and only minutes remaining, 170 picked up the ball on the edge of the box and nonchalantly chipped it over the goalie into the net for what would prove to be the winning goal.

This goal not only sealed victory for Panathinaikos but also symbolized their never-say-die attitude. Despite being down several players and facing significant odds, they persevered and found a way to win. This demonstrates that, even in difficult times, Panathinaikos can always rely on 170 to give his all for the team.

What makes 170 so special is not just his talent or his work ethic but also his humility and dedication to his teammates. He is constantly cheering them on whether he is playing or not and never gives up hope, no matter how bleak things may seem. This determination is what allows him to continue fighting even when things are going badly.

170 is an inspiration to everyone who loves Panathinaikos FC. He represents everything that is good about this proud club: resilience in face of adversity, unyielding determination, and pure love of the game. Through thick and thin, 170 will always give his best for Panathinaikos FC.
